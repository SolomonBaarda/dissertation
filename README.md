# Real-time Rendering of 3D “Fractal-like” Geometry
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype real-time rendering engine, capable of displaying complex 3D “fractal-like” geometry. The performance of the engine will be benchmarked across various systems to determine whether the “real-time” aspect of the project has been achieved.
