# Real-time Rendering of 3D “Fractal-like” Geometry



## Abstract
A fractal is a recursively created never-ending pattern that is usually self-similar. Separate from Euclidean geometry, fractal geometry describes the more non-uniform shapes found in nature, like clouds, mountains, and coastlines. Fractal patterns exist everywhere in the universe, whether we can see them or not. From DNA molecules to the structure of galaxies, and everything in between. Fractals patterns appear everywhere in nature and many technological breakthroughs have been made through studying them.

With the increasing popularity in fractal geometry, and increasing computing power, fractal rendering software has become far more common in the last decade. However, only a small number of these programs are capable of rendering 3D fractals in real time, and those that are capable, are mostly written using graphics shaders which contain lots of code duplication between scenes. This makes it hard for a beginner to get into rendering 3D fractals as they must be competent in the chosen shader language and must understand the complex theory of rendering fractals. This project aims to produce a real-time 3D fractal geometry renderer, for which it is easy for a user to create new scenes and add geometry to it.
