    <h1>Videos of benchmarks and common scenes</h1>

    <div style="padding:6px;">
        <p>
            This page contains videos of benchmarks and several other key scenes from the final build of
            the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application was running in 1920x1080 but the Windows 10 recording software seems to have
            compressed the videos quite enthusiastically so the quality appears worse than it actually was.

    <h2>Mandelbulb Benchmark</h2>
    <p>The main Mandelbulb benchmark scene. The Mandelbulb starts at power 7.75 and increases
        over time. The scene uses a fixed camera path for zooming into the Mandelbulb. This
        scene is the most computationally complex scene that has been tested on the application.
        Runs for 30 seconds.</p>

    <h2>Mandelbulb Stationary Benchmark</h2>
    <p>Variation of the Mandelbulb benchmark, which views the Mandelbulb from a distance using a
        stationary camera. This was used to test the efficiency of the bounding volume optimisation
        from a distance. Runs for 20 seconds.</p>

    <h2>Sierpinski Collection Benchmark</h2>
    <p>Benchmark scene containing the Sierpinski cube and tetrahedron. Uses a fixed camera path for
        navigating the scene. This scene contains two moderately complex fractals which is why it
        should be benchmarked. Runs for 25 seconds.</p>

    <h2>Planet Benchmark</h2>
    <p>Benchmark scene containing an Earth like planet. Uses a fixed camera path for zooming into the
        planet. This scene makes use of a C header noise function which may behave differently in OpenCL
        C which is why this scene should be benchmarked. Runs for 20 seconds.

    <h2>Trivial Benchmark</h2>
    <p>Trivial benchmark scene containing just a sphere and a plane. Uses a fixed camera. This scene is as
        simple as possible, which is why it should be benchmarked. Runs for 30 seconds.</p>

    <h2>Mandelbrot Zoom Scene</h2>
    <p>A basic zoom into the Mandelbrot set. The 2D Mandelbrot set is mapped onto a plane in 3D space 
        which the camera is viewing. Only basic colouring is used.</p>

    <h2>Sphere Box Scene</h2>
    <p>A simple scene featuring the union of a box and sphere. The primitives are combined using 
        smooth union and the smoothing factor is changed over time to blend between the two shapes differently.</p>

    <h2>Terrain Scene</h2>
    <p>Basic terrain including lakes and mountains with snow. This scene features bad visual artifacts 
        which occur from differences in values returned by the noise function for similar input ranges.</p>
