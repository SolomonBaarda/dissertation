    <h1>Videos of benchmarks and common scenes</h1>

    <h2>Mandelbulb Benchmark</h2>
    <a>The main Mandelbulb benchmark scene. The Mandelbulb starts at power 7.75 and increases
        over time. The scene uses a fixed camera path for zooming into the Mandelbulb. This 
        scene is the most computationally complex scene that has been tested on the application. 
        Runs for 30 seconds.</a>

    <h2>Mandelbulb Stationary Benchmark</h2>
    <a>Variation of the Mandelbulb benchmark, which views the Mandelbulb from a distance using a
        stationary camera. This was used to test the efficiency of the bounding volume optimisation
        from a distance. Runs for 20 seconds.</a>

    <h2>Sierpinski Collection Benchmark</h2>
    <a>Benchmark scene containing the Sierpinski cube and tetrahedron. Uses a fixed camera path for
        navigating the scene. This scene contains two moderately complex fractals which is why it 
        should be benchmarked. Runs for 25 seconds.</a>

    <h2>Planet Benchmark</h2>
    <a>Benchmark scene containing an Earth like planet. Uses a fixed camera path for zooming into the
        planet. This scene makes use of a C header noise function which may behave differently in OpenCL 
        C which is why this scene should be benchmarked. Runs for 20 seconds.

    <h2>Trivial Benchmark</h2>
    <a>Trivial benchmark scene containing just a sphere and a plane. Uses a fixed camera. This scene is as 
        simple as possible, which is why it should be benchmarked. Runs for 30 seconds.</a>
