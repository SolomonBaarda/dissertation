This version comes with a big update to the new mesh generator (BTracer2):
- even more speed
- true vertex colors (when using PLY as export format)
- using less memory, allowing to generate meshes with higher resolution
In short: make it even more fun!

See the included image "BulbTracer2r12.jpg" for a visual overview of the changes.

See the file CHANGES.txt for a list of changes.
