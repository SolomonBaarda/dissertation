I, DarkBeam @ FractalForums.com, did not make any of the images contained in the
folder.
None of them required attribution for use. All of them were freely downloadable.
Some maps come from collections of M3Maps found on DeviantArt. Thanks
to; CmdrChaos, Fractales75, Nic022, UndeadAcademy and all the people who shared.
Some images were marked as "free stock, no attribution needed".
Some cliparts come from a (very old!) CD of cliparts, where the rules were more or less those.

IMAGES 3046, 3047, 3048 are made by Kronpano at Deviantart, he granted me the permission
to host them together with all others. It would be nice to attribute the work to him
when you use maps 3046, 3047, 3048.
IMAGE 1633 is a photo by MandelWerk, he kindly shared it with us!
It would be nice to attribute the work to him.
