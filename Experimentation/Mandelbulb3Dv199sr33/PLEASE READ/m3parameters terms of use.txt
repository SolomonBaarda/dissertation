I, DarkBeam @ FractalForums.com, did not make all the parameters contained in the
folder.

My parameters are just experiments that you should use to learn new techniques
(edventually)

I don't care what you do with my parameters BUT you MUST repsect the other artist works;
if a parameter has a nickname attached to it, you REALLY should give appropriate
credit to the artist who contributed it; this applies to all parameters that
can be found online really.
