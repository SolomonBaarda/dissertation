<P>A short description for the use of Mandelbulb 3D version 1.8.9<BR>
</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<BR>
<div align="center">
<P>Mandelbulb 3D is a program designed for the Windows platform, for generating  <BR>
3D views of different fractals.<BR>
The rendering is based on distance estimates (DE), you might find this<BR>
shortcut in some of the explanations.</P>
<P>Many thanks to the people on FractalForums.com, <BR>
especially to David Makin for helping with implementing DE, also to Buddhi for <BR>
the fast DE method for the amazing box, msltoe for the riemannian formula, <BR>
Tglad for the Amazing Box, Fracmonk for the CommQuat formula, Trafassel for<BR>
the IdesFormula, Kali, Bethchen, all i forgot, for even more formulas, and of<BR>
course Luca (DarkBeam) for many, many own made formulas!<BR>
Not at least thanks to Daniel White, whose fast int power formulas I am using<BR>
and for developing some of the first 3d bulbs together with Paul Nylander.<BR>
Also to Syntopia and all the others for inspiration, helping, testing, for<BR>
suggestions, and the people of Nasa and Gimp for the awesome work and the maps<BR>
i generated from their work (and hopefully there is no restriction in using<BR>
them this way).<BR>
Also a big thanks to all who supported m3d, me and others with kind words,<BR>
lightmaps, cool renderings and their parameters!  </P>

<a name="installation"></a>
<P><h2>Installation:</h2></P>
<HR>
<P>An installation is not necessary, extract the whole archive to a folder of your<BR>
choice and start the program by clicking on the 'Mandelbulb3D' executable.<BR>
If not all formulas are available, specify the formula directory by clicking on<BR>
the 'Initial directories' button in the 'INI' tab.</P>
<BR>
<a name="Zoomingandnavigating"></a>
<P><h2>Zooming and navigating:</h2></P>
<HR>
<P>The easiest way is to use the 3d navigator that i recommend and will explain<BR>
in an extra topic later on.</P>
<P>
The other way for navigating is to use the 2D mouse functions to step and zoom<BR>
via 2D slices to different positions.  You can select on the bottom left side<BR>
of the programs window three options by clicking on these buttons: </P>
<P>
1. Button is for zooming, a double click in the image will zoom in the clicked<BR>
position by a factor of 1.4 .  Left-click for zooming in, Right-click for<BR>
zooming out.  You can also mark an area in the image to zoom into it.<BR>
These zoomings are performed at the Zmid slice, the other Z values are<BR>
changed relative to it and does not care about the object itself.  That<BR>
means that a 3d calculation could slice the object or sending parameters to<BR>
the navigator can make problems like with all other 2d functions.</P>
<P>
2. Button to shift the image in horizontal and vertical directions.</P>
<P>
3. Button to navigate the slice in Z direction, seen from the viewport of the<BR>
beholder.  This is useful to get a better imagination of the location or to<BR>
back in front of the object.</P>
<P>
And you can rotate the bulb around the point that is given by the Xmid, Ymid<BR>
and Zmid values by clicking on the arrow buttons below the main image window.</P>
<P>
In the 'Position' menu:<BR>
The Zstart position defines the start of rays to be calculated, Zend defines<BR>
where calculation ends, if no object until then has been found.<BR>
These values are relative to the Zmid and the actual view direction, so<BR>
Zstart is always lower than Zend.<BR>
Hints:<BR>
Increase the Zend value, if parts in the background are missing, but do<BR>
not choose larger values than needed.<BR>
It is more recommended to use the 'farplane' value in the navigator for<BR>
this purpose (use F1 and F2 for de/increasing the value). <BR>
With high Zend values, use the 24bit or the DEAO ambient shadow functions<BR>
to avoid banding artifacts.</P>
<P>
'get midpoint':<BR>
The midpoint can be taken directly from the object in the rendered image by<BR>
clicking on this button and afterwards on the image part.</P>
<P>
'reset':<BR>
To reset the position, rotation and zoom to default start values.<BR>
If the R bailout value is bigger than 500, it will be more zoomed out, so<BR>
push this button after selecting the 'amazing box', for example.<BR>
<BR>
Hint:<BR>
The zoom value is not really intended for large changes by the user, use<BR>
the navigator instead to zoom into the object, the value is adjusted auto-<BR>
matically.</P>
<P>
In the 'Rotation' menu:<BR>
You can change the rotation angles by hand, but you must press 'apply to<BR>
image' to insert them to the parameters.  A rotation matrix is generated<BR>
from them (the internal format of rotation) and afterwards the euler angles<BR>
are calculated again from this matrix and will be shown.  These can differ<BR>
from the original ones!  On Y rotation near to 90 or -90 degrees, the euler<BR>
angles can't be calculated at all from the matrix!</P>
<P>
Calc-:<BR>
Calculates a 8x8 blocky image, for example to roughly locate structures<BR>
to preview with a selective recalculation in the postprocessing formular.<BR>
Calculate 3D:<BR>
Main rendering of the current parameters.<BR>
Choose the options for hard and ambient shadows in the postprocessing<BR>
formular before if you want them to be calculated automatically or to<BR>
disable the automatic calculation.<BR>
Formulas, Postprocess and Lighting:<BR>
Brings up the specific formulars for making changes.<BR>
Rightclick on these buttons to choose from the sticky options.<BR>
</P>
<P>
Note:  The image size is limited because a 32 bit program can use only about<BR>
2 to 3 GB of memory, dependend on the operating system and its settings.<BR>
Some postprocessings need also additional memory (SSAO15, DoF), so the<BR>
absolute limit would be 100 megapixel, but to use postprocessings and<BR>
not run into any trouble, i suggest to go no much higher than 50 MPixel.</P>
<P>
For huge renderings the new 'Big renders' tool is available in the<BR>
'Utilities' tab on the top-left corner of the program.</P>

<a name="navigator"></a>
<P><h2>3D NAVIGATOR</h2></P>
<HR>
<P>This feature is useful for an intuitive navigation through the fractal, like in<BR>
first person games.<BR>
First started, it uses the actual settings from the main program, later on you<BR>
can use the 'Parameter' button to insert all main settings or 'Formula' to<BR>
insert only the actual formula settings.<BR>
You can also change only the light by choosing one of the user defined lightings<BR>
'1' to '3' or press 'Light' to insert the current light settings.  Anyways, the<BR>
navigator uses a simpler lighting, so the actual light in the navigator image<BR>
differs from the main programs image.</P>
<P>
In the navi the actual zoom is calculated from the local DE value, this is the<BR>
reason why sometimes the object will appear more tiny when stepping forward,<BR>
because the local DE became smaller while passing a nearby structure and the<BR>
programs nearplane (not a pointlike camera) becomes smaller.<BR>
<BR>
If you use the keyboard to navigate, all movings can be performed with the left<BR>
hand and all rotations with the right hand.  Use the keys that are shown beside<BR>
the belonging buttons.</P>
<P>
Additional navigating with the mouse is possible in two modes:<BR>
you can move towards the object and back with the mousewheel, if you place the<BR>
cursor over a part of the image, you also change to this direction when stepping<BR>
forwards.<BR>
The second mode is activated by leftclicking on the image,  leftclick again or<BR>
press the Escape button to turn back from this mode.  <BR>
In this mode the view direction is changed by moving the mouse, if you hold the<BR>
right mousebutton down while moving, a rolling is performed instead.<BR>
The mousewheel option depends of whether the option 'Fixed zoom and steps' is<BR>
set.  If so, then you can change the zoom-factor, else you step forward or back<BR>
like in the other mode.<BR>
You can rightclick in the navigator image to choose the option for changing to<BR>
the second mode: by single or double click.</P>
<P>
Click the button on the lower right side to open the option panel for specifying<BR>
step sizes, rotating angles and some other options.<BR>
Popup hints should appear when the mouse cursor is over the edit fields.</P>
<P>
Fixed zoom and steps (F6):<BR>
To disable the automatic zoom changing, what leeds also to stepping through<BR>
the bulb.</P>
<P>
Note: Do not start the navigator or insert parameters, when inside a bulb.<BR>
Or you could try to enable the 'fixed zoom and steps' option first.</P>
<P>
Hint: If the view disappears because of local low DE values, look at the zoom<BR>
value and step towards decreasing values, and/or increase the far plane value.</P>
<P>
Until version 1.7.0 you got some more key shortcuts, please look at the<BR>
extended option panel for the F-keys options.</P>
<P>
Use the 'fixed zoom and steps' option for navigating if you are in an<BR>
'inside rendering'.</P>
<P>
The right adjusting panel is accessible by clicking on the arrow button on<BR>
the bottom right side.  Adjustments should be intuitive to handle.<BR>
Beside the usage of sliders, you can also click on the values directly and<BR>
input a new value.</P>
<P>
Use the 'show coords' checkbox to get the orientation of the current<BR>
coordinate system in the middle of the navi image.<BR>
This is useful for getting the right cutting plane for example.</P>

<a name="FORMULATAB"></a>
<P><h2>FORMULA TAB</h2></P>
<HR>
<P>Here you can specify the formulas you want to calculate, in case only a few<BR>
are available, you have to set the formula directory in the 'Ini' tab of the main window.</P>
<P>
Choose a formula and calculate the 3D version to see the differences.<BR>
Formulas that have a '_' (underline) character in front its name are only<BR>
useful in alternating hybrids, they are not intended for standalone use.</P>
<P>
The formulas have often additional option values that can be changed too.<BR>
Please tryout.</P>
<P>
You can choose several formulas that are calculated behind each other to give an<BR>
alternating hybrid. Each formula is repeated n times by the option value that is<BR>
given with 'iteration count'.<BR>
Set 'iteration count' to zero to deactivate the formula or select an empty field<BR>
in the formula selecting menus to remove it.</P>
<P>Repeat from here:<BR>
&nbsp;When choosing several formulas that are calculated in a row, this option<BR>
&nbsp;specifies where the next iteration starts after finishing the last formula in<BR>
&nbsp;the tabs.  So you can make one or more iterations with the first formula(s),<BR>
&nbsp;that is(are) never used again.</P>
<P>R bailout:<BR>
&nbsp;This gives the bailout value that indicates if the point belongs to the<BR>
&nbsp;mandelset (after n iterations) or not (when R becomes greater than R stop).<BR>
&nbsp;To low values results in artifacts.<BR>
<BR>
Minimum and maximum iteration counts:<BR>
&nbsp;The formula is repeated at least the minimum iteration count and then<BR>
&nbsp;iterated further until R becomes greater than the bailout value, or the<BR>
&nbsp;maximum iteration count is reached.</P>
<P>Inside rendering:<BR>
&nbsp;To show the inside of bulbs, this option is slow especially for larger<BR>
&nbsp;images.  The stepsizes are very small and at full iteration count, reduce<BR>
&nbsp;the maximum iteration value to a value not very bigger than the average<BR>
&nbsp;iteration count in the statistic tab to gain calculation speed.<BR>
&nbsp;The 'raystep multiplier' affects also the stepsizes and so the calculation<BR>
&nbsp;speed.<BR>
     Note: Use the 'fixed zoom and steps' option in the extended navigator panel.</P>
<P>3D:   Formulas that have not a special analytically DE method, using the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 point DE method.<BR>
3Da:  Formulas with an analytic DE based on an additional value (currently<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the w variable, what can cause some interferences with 4d formulas).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation is commonly faster then the non analytically ones.<BR>
4D:   Same as 3D but using also the w variable.<BR>
4Da:  Like 3Da, but using another variable for the analytic calculation.<BR>
Adds: Formulas that are not intended for standalone usage.</P>
<P>Notes: <BR>
&nbsp;You can mix all formulas, but some combination may lead to<BR>
&nbsp;unsatisfying results.  This is because the needed DE function can not<BR>
&nbsp;be obtained always.  Mixing analytic formulas with nonanalytic ones<BR>
&nbsp;results in a nonanalytic calculation.</P>
<P> Older formulas included in previous versions of Mandelbub 3D might not<BR>
work with version 1.5 or later versions and vice versa.<BR>
The actual program loads only the working ones.  </P>
<P>Mistrust formulas that were not included in the archiv, because they<BR>
are containing pure machine code what causes risks.</P>
<P>'Interpolate' hybrid:<BR>
&nbsp;In this function two formulas can be interpolated. Both formulas are<BR>
&nbsp;calculated for each iteration and the results are averaged with the given<BR>
&nbsp;weights that can be a floating point value.</P>
<P>'DEcombinate' hybrid:<BR>
&nbsp;Here you can combine two formulas, in the 'min' option (shown in the first<BR>
&nbsp;formula tab) the formulas are both complete, 'max' excludes both formulas,<BR>
&nbsp;meaning that the combined object is only where both formulas were present.<BR>
&nbsp;The 'Inv max' option inverts the first formula and combines both 'maximum'.<BR>
&nbsp;This can be used for cutting out the first shape (dIFS preferred) from the<BR>
&nbsp;second formula (F2 to F6).<BR>
&nbsp;'Min lin' and 'Min nlin' are like 'min' but got an overlap function between<BR>
&nbsp;both formulas.<BR>
&nbsp;'Mix1' and 'Mix2' are performing the begining formula(s) and afterwards the<BR>
&nbsp;second formula(s) are performes on the altered Z vector. The second formula<BR>
&nbsp;is recommended to be a dIFS one.<BR>
&nbsp;'Mix1' is using F1 as beginning formula whereas 'Mix2' is using F2-F6 to<BR>
&nbsp;start with. <BR>
<BR>
You can vote formulas by rightclicking on them in the dropdown menus, this<BR>
might help to find your formulas faster.<BR>
By typing in directly into the formulas name edit field, a list of formulas<BR>
fitting to the actual letters, are shown to choose from.<BR>
<BR>
Rightclicking on the formula header tabs (F1..F6) will bring up a menu for<BR>
moving and copying formulas or values.<BR>

<P><h2>OPTION TABS</h2></P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P><a name="calculation"></a>
<P>CALCULATION:</P>
<HR>
<P>(All of the changes to these values have only an effect when recalculating <BR>
the 3D bulb or a selection.)</P>
<P>
DE stop:<BR>
This value indicates a stop condition for the search of the mandelset.  When<BR>
the DE (Distance Estimation) function estimates a value lower than DEstop,<BR>
and the iteration count is higher than the minimum iterations value, the<BR>
program assumes that the set was found.</P>
<P>
The value for the DE is related to the width of a pixel, so a DEstop value<BR>
of 1 will stop about one pixels before the set (this may vary little by<BR>
the formula used, because the DE is not optimized yet for every formula).<BR>
A lower value will show more details, as long as the maximum iteration<BR>
count does not limit the details by giving an earlier stop condition.</P>
<P>
Vary DEstop on FOV:<BR>
By default enabled, gives it the DEstop a higher value in far areas to get<BR>
a faster and more aliasing free rendering.</P>
<P>
Raystep multiplier: (was: DE accuracy)<BR>
This value scales the stepwidth in the search for the mandelset.<BR>
Lower values are giving more precision to find finer details at the cost of<BR>
rendering speed. To high values (bigger than 0.6) can lead to heavy<BR>
overstepping.</P>
<P>
Stepwidth limiter:<BR>
If decreasing the Raystep multiplier to 0.1 and still overstepping occurs,<BR>
lower this value also to 0.1 or less.</P>
<P>
Stepcount for Binary Search:<BR>
Calculates n more steps after the stop condition, to stear the location<BR>
on the ray to an exact position.  This is essential for calculating good<BR>
normals or in case of Iteration Count Limiting to set the points all to<BR>
the same (smoothed) Count.</P>
<P>
Smooth Normals:<BR>
A value greater than zero calculates the normals from the mean of several<BR>
points and generates a kind of roughness value for a better anti aliasing.<BR>
This is useful when the coloring looks noisy in high detailed areas.<BR>
A value of 2 is mostly enough, higher values are not leading to much changes.</P>
<P>
Normals on DE:<BR>
If activated, the normals will be calculated from distance estimates.<BR>
This is a good option for bulbs, as long as no artifacts occur, try out.<BR>
On formulas and hybrids that uses own DE methods, the normals are always<BR>
calculated from the DE's. </P>
<P>
First step random:<BR>
This option multiplies the first raymarching step by a random number<BR>
to give overstepping artifacts a random character and it can also reduce<BR>
banding artifacts in the dynamic fog for example.</P>
<P>
Raystep sub DEstop:<BR>
Subtracts an amount from the DEstop from the next raystep to avoid<BR>
overstepping with higher DEstop values.  I recommend this with DEstop<BR>
values of about 2 and higher, but also on lower values this can be<BR>
helpful with dIFS.</P>
<P>
'M' button:<BR>
You can change the parameters for the presets ('preview', 'video', 'mid',<BR>
'high').  When clicked, hit one of the preset buttons to save the current<BR>
values in the calculation tab plus the values for the image width and the<BR>
image scale.  The image height is calculated automatically to preserve the<BR>
aspect ratio.  If you clicked by accident, click again to cancel. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<a name="COLORING"></a>
<P>COLORING:</P>
<HR>
<P>Mode for 2. color choice:<BR>
Orbit trap:<BR>
Based on the minimum distance to 0 while iterating.<BR>
Works also with pure IFS.<BR>
Last length increase:<BR>
Is the last increment factor of the 3d vector length multiplied by the<BR>
'Lli multiplier'.  If the color histogram between the object color start<BR>
and end sliders is on the left side you can increase this value.<BR>
Rout angles:<BR>
Computes the arctan2 function of the components on bailout.<BR>
Might be options on the Amazing box, check out on preview bulbs.<BR>
Color map on input vec:<BR>
Calculates x and y coordinates out of the actual position (x,y,z) for<BR>
an object map.  It overrides the standard color method on smoothed<BR>
iterations!<BR>
Map on output vector:<BR>
Calculates x and y coordinates out of the iterated output vec (x,y,z)<BR>
for an object map.  It overrides also the standard color method.</P>
<P>
The selected mode is computed in the main rendering and afterwards available<BR>
as second coloring option in the Lighting-&gt;'Object colors' panel.<BR>
Changes takes only effect on a new rendering.</P>
<a name="VOLUMETRIC LIGHT"></a>
<P>
The dynamic fog on iteration option will add fog/glow only if the ray goes<BR>
through this iteration level (on bailout in escapetime or on minimum distance<BR>
in dIFS formulas).  A zero value disables this option and the d.fog is<BR>
calculated on the amount of raysteps until the object reached. </P>
<p>
Volumetric light:</p>
<p>
By clicking the 'Dyn. fog on it:' button you can choose the volumetric<BR>
light option. Insert the light number on which this effect should be calculated.<BR>
The resolution of the light map can be tuned by the up/down buttons in 20<BR>
percent steps.<BR>
Avoid a to large 'Zend' value in combination with a global volumetric light,<BR>
because this needs very large maps to cover the whole scene, resulting in<BR>
a low map resolution.<BR>
This would be very obvious in animations, when the light effect flickers.</p>
<p>
After calculation you can use the same control as for the dynamic fog<BR>
option in the lighting panel. Rightclick on the 'Dyn.fog' button to insert<BR>
the color from the choosen volumetric light.</p>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<a name="INTERNAL"></a>
<P>INTERNAL:</P>
<HR>
<P>Threadcount in Calculations:<BR>
This value is set on program startup automatically, according to the<BR>
number of processor cores in the computer.  If the program is too<BR>
fast ;-) or you need extra power for other programs, set it to a lower<BR>
value.  Choosing more threads than you have cores, normally does not<BR>
increase the calculation speed, but can have a bad effect on stability,<BR>
so this should be avoided.<BR>
<BR>
You can disable the automatic detection by unchecking the<BR>
'Autodetect on start' option.  The program then will start with the user<BR>
adjusted amount of threads for calculations.</P>
<P>Thread Priority:<BR>

<P>Clicking on the 'Postprocess' button brings up this options formular.</P>
<a name="RecalculateSelection"></a>
<P>
Recalculate a Selection:<BR>
If you enable this function and make a selection with the mouse in the<BR>
image, you can recalculate this selection with different parameters or<BR>
the same for some reasons:  reduce overstepping artifacts in some parts<BR>
of the image, or to preview some settings before you start rendering.<BR>
In case of reducing artifacts afterwards, there are several options to<BR>
choose from.  If you are using a lot of dynamic fog in the image, the<BR>
only good choice is to keep all parameters, just enable the 'First<BR>
step random' option in the calculation tab plus the 'Keep only nearer<BR>
parts' and recalculate until the result looks ok.<BR>
If the dynamic fog is not that important, use a 'Raystep divisor' value<BR>
of 2 or higher to reduce overstepping a lot.</P>
<P>
Note:  Enable the automatic processing of the hard and ambient shadows<BR>
so that they will be also calculated, but Only the DEAO ambient<BR>
shadow can be calculated automatically!<BR>
If you are using a different one, you have to recalculate the<BR>
ambient shadow for the whole image afterwards!</P>
<a name="NormalsZBuffer"></a>
<P>
Normals on Z-Buffer:<BR>
You can try this function if the surface normals of the object seems to<BR>
be wrong (noisy or very flat look).<BR>
Warning: Save the rendering first as m3i file, because you have to<BR>
rerender all to make this function undo!</P>
<a name="HardShadows"></a>
<P>
Hard Shadows:<BR>
Calculate the shadows from the light sources on the object. Choose only<BR>
the lights you want to calculate or recalculate the shadow, for example<BR>
if the position or the angle of the light was changed.<BR>
The 'Max length calculation' value is a factor for the default length<BR>
up to the hard shadow will be calculated.  If shadows of distant objects<BR>
are missing, try to increase the value and recalculate that shadow.<BR>
If you calculate only one shadow, you can choose now an option for a<BR>
more smooth shadow, that would be also nicer in animations because it<BR>
fades softer in and out too.  It relies on the DE, so it might not work<BR>
in inside renderings or with formula combinations leading to bad DE's.</P>
<a name="AmbientShadows"></a>
<P>
Ambient Shadows:<BR>
This an automatically (by default) calculated shadow, and the result is<BR>
obviously.<BR>
The Z/R threshold limits the influence of strong depth changes, as in<BR>
disconnected fore and background parts.<BR>
The option 'Threshold to 0' lets the threshold decrease the shadow down<BR>
to 0, so far parts are not affected by nearby parts.  But this option<BR>
can lead to stripes on parts inbetween.<BR>
Use the 24 bit functions if banding  or blocking artifacts are visible.<BR>
The 'r' function reduces blockings further more by randomizing the<BR>
sample positions.  Some noise can be visible, this is not solved in the<BR>
current version yet.<BR>
The DEAO method does not relay on the Z Buffer and is therefore also<BR>
very good for video animations.<BR>
The dithering options must be choosen for the correct output scale of<BR>
the image, else you get dithering artifacts.  This function reduces<BR>
spotty artifacts by varying the ray angles.<BR>
The FSR (first step random) option reduces them too, but can introduce<BR>
some random noise.  Less noise On higher raycounts and downscales.<BR>

<BR>
<a name="Reflections"></a>
<BR>
Reflections + Transparency:<BR>
Calculate direct reflections on the surface of the objects.  The amount<BR>
depends on the brightness of the specular colors, multiplied by the<BR>
'Amount' value.  To high Spec values can lead to amplified light on the<BR>
surface, so choose wisely.<BR>
The 'Depth' value determines how many reflections should be calculated<BR>
at maximum.  So if you want to see a reflection on a already relfected<BR>
object, you have to choose a value of 2. <BR>
You can render a rectangular selection in the image for a fast preview:<BR>
Enable the corresponding option at the bottom, make a selection on the<BR>
image with the mouse and press 'Calculate now' to render the selection.</P>
<P>
Tips: A mirror would be made of white specular color, black diffuse<BR>
color, and a 'Spec' value of 1 (in the reflection settings).<BR>
Use also background images with reflections.<BR>
Enable 'Calculate H.S. automatically' and 'Calculate A.S automa-<BR>
tically' if the shadows should also be calculated in the<BR>
reflections.</P>
<P>
Choose 'Calculate transparency' to calculate also inside going rays.<BR>
Because inside rendering on escapetime fractals is slow, you can<BR>
enable this only for dIFS formulas by checking 'Only dIFS'.<BR>
The amount of transparency depends on the object transparent color and<BR>
the 'Gain' value, that should be 1 if you want full transparency.</P>
<P>
The transparency affects also the specular amount, the total light is<BR>
split into refraction and reflection dependend on the incident light<BR>
angle.<BR>
Use white specular color with white (255) transparent color to get a<BR>
full transparent object.  Lowering the specular amount would be like<BR>
an antirelfex coating for the surface.<BR>
The diffuse color affects the absorption and the light scattering<BR>
inside the material, both parameters are multiplied by the according<BR>
'Absorption' and 'Light scattering' values.<BR>
'Refraction index' specifies the material index, air is 1 (no change<BR>
of light angle), water ~1.33, glass ~1.5 and diamond ~2.4.</P>
<P>
Because for every 'Depth' of calculation, the ray is split into<BR>
reflective part and refractive part, the amount of calculated rays is<BR>
growing exponential with each depth.  So it can be very time consuming.</P>
<a name="DepthofField"></a>
<P>
Depth of Field:<BR>
The blurring from the optic can be simulated. Choose the distance from<BR>
the beholder that should be sharp by clicking on the 'Get Z from image'<BR>
button and afterwards on the specific object detail in the image.<BR>
'ClipRadius' is limiting the maximal radius when calculation.<BR>
'Aperture' specifies the blur change at the Zsharp point.  It is not<BR>
the aperture of the camera.  You can multiply the value by a freely<BR>
choosen distance from the camera to the Zsharp point and divide it<BR>
by the cameras lense focal length to get the cameras aperture.<BR>
For example: if you would like to have a camera aperture of 1:4 with<BR>
a focal length of 100mm and the Zsharp point should be 1m in front<BR>
of the camera, the 'Aperture' value must be 1/4 * 100 / 1000 = 0.025.</P>
<P>
The DoF function is also not stored in the main buffer, so all light<BR>
changes will reset this calculation.<BR>
Note: Because of the new 'Reflections' function, the effect will not be<BR>
automatically reset on a new calculation.  You can reset it by<BR>
pressing the 'Reset now' button beside the 'Caution-message',<BR>
else the effect accumulates on each calculation.</P>

<P>
Use a map for the diffuse color:<BR>
You can use maps for the diffuse object colors.<BR>
The map position is derived from smooth iterations and the calculated<BR>
2nd color choice.<BR>
Specular and transparent colors are still derived from the non-map<BR>

Also a downscaled background image can be used for the ambient coloring,<BR>
what might add some realism.  This is intended for a spherical usage of<BR>
the background image.<BR>
If you use a background image, make sure the filename is not longer than<BR>

<P>The '*.m3i' files are including all calculated values from the image, also<BR>
the parameter and light settings.  The reflections and the DoF effect will<BR>
also be stored if 'Img' is checked.<BR>
It is always stored with fullsize, no matter of the current view-scaling.<BR>
Animation, Voxelstack and Big-renders have own savings of their special<BR>
parameters, they are not stored in a m3i file.</P>
<P>
The '*.m3p' files are the parameters only, which include also the light<BR>
adjustments.  They contain compressed data and are not editable with a text<BR>
editor.</P>
<P>
Hints: The program generates a directory 'Mandelbulb3D' in the user's Local<BR>
application data (AppData) folder, where some user defined presets<BR>
are stored in, like the lighting presets.<BR>
Save the current parameter as 'default.m3p' in the programs folder or<BR>
in the initial parameters folder to load these settings on program<BR>
startup automatically.</P>
<P>
You can save and load the parameters also as text to and from the clipboard:<BR>
Loading:  Mark the text and press 'Ctrl + C' to copy it to the clipboard.<BR>
Then press the loading button 'TXT'.<BR>
Saving:  Press the saving button 'TXT' and insert it with 'Ctrl + V' somewhere.</P>
<P>
Since version 1.8 you can also drag&amp;drop textfiles or Png files with included<BR>
parameters directly onto the programs main window to load them.</P>
<P>
When saving a downscaled image in the BMP, PNG or JPEG file format, a good<BR>
antialiasing filter is performed before to give a better result<BR>
(for downscales of 1:2 and 1:3 only).<BR>
Note that images are stored downscaled, like the current view.</P>
<P>
You can declare the JPEGs quality in the edit field, or, with a value greater<BR>
than 100, you can specify the maximum filesize in kilobyte.  The maximum<BR>
quality is then calculated automatically.</P>
<P>
The '*.m3f' files are the formula files.  They are in a readable and editable<BR>
text file format, but the formula itself is in machine code.</P>
<P>
And '*.m3a' files hold the animation settings.  They contain compressed data<BR>
and are not editable with a text editor.</P>
<P>
On program shutdown, the last parameters are copied to the clipboard in<BR>
textformat.  So you can load them again immediately, if you forgot to save<BR>
them, for example.</P>

<P>I hope that most functions are self explaining, some hints are popping up when<BR>
the cursor is over a button or an edit field.</P>
<P>
The base function is to insert key frames from the actual parameters of the main<BR>
programs window or from the navigator.<BR>
The images inbetween are calculated from the interpolated values.  Here you can<BR>
define a smoothing factor for each keyframe, 0 leads to a linear interpolation<BR>
to and from this keyframe, higher values gives a rounded, bezier like<BR>
interpolation.  In the newer program versions you can only choose between linear<BR>
and bezier interpolation.<BR>
So with bezier, the original keyframe parameters must not be reached in all<BR>
cases, instead the midpoint between two keyframes are passed over.  To still<BR>
start with the first keyframe, duplicate the first KF (insert it towards the<BR>
first and second KF) and set the first subframecount to zero.  Same with ending<BR>
on the last keyframe, setting the last KF's subframecount to zero.<BR>
With the preview you can get a good impression of the flight path, so check this<BR>
before starting the main rendering.</P>
<P>
If you want to change specific values of a single keyframe, insert the<BR>
parameters of the keyframe to the main program with the button above the<BR>
keyframe, then change the parameters and insert them again with the button<BR>
below the keyframe to it. </P>
<P>
Mostly all values, including lighting can be changed and will be interpolated.</P>
<P>
The 'Start with index:' value is helpful, when a previous animation rendering<BR>
was stopped.  The rendering starts with this image index, so look what the<BR>
last image index was.  The 'File index:' values have to be left as they were.</P>
<P>Hint:  The length of the Output Folder name should not exceed 255 characters,<BR>
any more than that will not be saved in the '.m3a' file.</P>

<HR>
<P>This is a more realistic renderer but it may take up to 100 times longer to<BR>
render the same image as by default!<BR>
Some hints on speeding up calculations in the default rendering as preview:<BR>
-  Render in 1:1 view, a special antialiasing is usually not needed<BR>
-  Increase the raystep multiplier until the first oversteppings occur and<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lower it only slightly.  Little oversteppings are not that visible later<BR>
-  Hard shadows will always be calculated, switch off all lights that would<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;give no big light amount or lies outside a room, use positional lights<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to light a room inside.  The only way to switch off the HS calc would be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to decrease the max length calcuation to 0.<BR>
-  When using dIFS make sure the maximum iterations value is as low as<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;possible because it is aways calculated up to the maximum value.<BR>
-  The ambient and reflects rays depth values influences rendering speed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of course, to low values affects the realism.</P>
<P>  To change parameters you can use the 'Send parameter to main' button, modify<BR>
  settings there and 'Import parameter' back then.<BR>
  The parameter will also be changed when sending, so the output of the main renderer<BR>
  comes closer to the MC result.</P>
<P>Use 'MaxL' in the postprocess DEAO settings to change the maximum calculated ambient<BR>
ray length, same for 'max length calc' of hard shadows in its tab.</P>
<P>You can always stop the calculations and start again for continuing rendering.</P>
<P>Gamma, contrast and soft clipping can be changed at all time.<BR>
<BR>
To use the automatic file storing option, you first have to save the M3C file.</P>
<P>  The dynamic fog can easily destroy realism, for example when light is subtracted.<BR>
An intern gamma of 2 ('I2' in the lighting tab) is also recommended.</P>
<P>  Not all caustics are implemented because it would take to much time to<BR>
  render. Light behind transparent objects is not accurate for example.</P>
<P><B>WARNING:</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This renderer shares maps with the main renderer, if you are using<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;maps for lights, diffuse color, background and/or calcuations, i<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recommend to not touch the main renderer or you could loose maps<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the MC renderer would produce crap!</P>
