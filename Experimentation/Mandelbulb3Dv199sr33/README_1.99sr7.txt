It may be of little interest, but MB3D comes with an official major update to the mesh-generator. 
In fact, the module was rewritten, in order to achieve the following goals:
 - get much better results
 - to be much faster
 - (optionally) generate color-information
 - make it simpler to use
In short: make it fun!

See the included image "BulbTracer2.jpg" for a visual overview of the changes and have fun!
