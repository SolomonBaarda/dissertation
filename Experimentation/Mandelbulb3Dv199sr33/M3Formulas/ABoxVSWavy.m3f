This formula has been suggested by Aexion in FF. I modified and generalized it a bit.
Same as normal ABox Vary Scale but "r" is replaced by a more complicated expression,
to get new "wavy" effects instead of a normal sphere inversion;

// do the folding, then;
rho = sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z); // the radius
theta1 = cos(f*x) * sin(f*y) + cos(f*y) * sin(f*z) + cos(f*z) * sin(f*x);
theta2 = cos(f*x) + cos(f*y) + cos(f*z);
if (mulmode == 1) {
r = theta1 * Amp + rho * (theta2 * Amp2 + Rmul);
} else {
r = theta1 * Amp + theta2 * Amp2 + rho * Rmul; 
} endif
// use r for the inversion and add c

Some hints.
- I often noticed that neg scale looks better. Try it!
- Wave frq: Don't set too high values, or the fractal will look overly busy
- Radius mul: Keep it near to 1, and use low amplitudes, to make the fractal 
look more "boxy" or the deformation will be stronger (Amplitudes = 0 and rmul
= 1 gives the normal ABoxVS)
- Alt mode: Wave2 will interfer with the radius multiplier, even more possibilities
for strange looks! ( Has effect when Wave2 amp > 0 )

- "Original" Aexion formula
It's very interesting. Set scale = -2, minr>0.5, Wave amp = 3 (or anything 
you like), frq <= 1, fold = 1 (or anything you like), any other param = 0.
Tends to look a bit too busy but it can be good.
