Description:

Moves x, y, z, w values to Cx, Cy, Cz, Cw.

This allows you to calculate any 4d Mandelbrot-like set in warped coordinates.
IFS are not affected by C.
Remember that all transforms MUST be used as pretransforms, put this AFTER all of them,
then put the set (or the sets). Check repeat from here in the first M-set.
